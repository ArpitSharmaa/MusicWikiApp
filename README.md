# MusicWikiApp
The development of the application prioritized the inclusion 
of all the basic features that were required. The initial step 
involved the creation of the necessary data classes for fetching 
the data. As the objective was to make the application online, Room
 database was not used. Although this limited some of the functionalities, 
it ensured that the latest information was always accessible to the users.

To fetch the data, the GET annotation was utilized. Subsequently, the data
 was passed on to the viewmodel, which facilitated the display of the information 
on the user interface. To present the information in a more organized manner, recycler
 view was implemented for all the lists in the application. The 'press to show' feature was
 also incorporated to provide users with an optimal experience.

Throughout the development process, emphasis was placed on keeping the code clean and easy
 to understand. This helped in reducing the likelihood of errors and made the maintenance of 
the application more manageable. By incorporating all the essential functionalities and ensuring 
that the code was well-structured, the application was designed to meet the needs of the users.
